This is a practice repo to learn contributing, opening PR and resolving merge conflict on github.
To get started:
- first fork the repo in your github account using the fork button in the repo.
- clone the forked repo in your local. `git clone <forked-repo-url>.
- create a new branch in the forked repo with your name. for eg `git checkout -b devansh`.
- add your name and github profile in the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file.
- commit changes. `git commit -m "add devansh"`
- push changes in your forked repo, `git push origin devansh`.
- go to github and open a new PR to merge into the upstream main branch.

There might be merge conflicts, so have fun resolving'em.
for any issue feel free to use ProGit [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2] or any other online resource.
